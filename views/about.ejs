        This purpose of this website is to be able to share details on hosted servers for people to join.
        People will be able to add games, players, and servers. If a game you are hosting isn't listed you can add it.
        You can add players to the database to keep track of who uses the site and plays games.
        You'll also be able to add a new server if you decide to host your own as well as delete old servers that are
        no longer running.
